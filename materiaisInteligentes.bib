	abstract = {Piezoelectric vibration-based energy harvesting systems have been used as an interesting alternative power source for actuators and portable devices. These systems have an inherent disadvantage when operating in linear conditions, presenting a maximum power output by matching their resonance frequencies with the ambient source frequencies. Based on that, there is a significant reduction of the output power due to small frequency deviations, resulting in a narrowband harvester system. Nonlinearities have been shown to play an important role in enhancing the harvesting capacity. This work deals with the use of nonsmooth nonlinearities to obtain a broadband harvesting system. A numerical investigation is undertaken considering a single-degree-of-freedom model with a mechanical end-stop. The results show that impacts can strongly modify the system dynamics, resulting in an increased broadband output power harvesting performance and introducing nonlinear effects as dynamical jumps. Nonsmoothness can increase the bandwidth of the harvesting system but, on the other hand, limits the energy capacity due to displacement constraints. A parametric analysis is carried out monitoring the energy capacity, and two main end-stop characteristics are explored: end-stop stiffness and gap. Dynamical analysis using proper nonlinear tools such as Poincaré maps, bifurcation diagrams, and phase spaces is performed together with the analysis of the device output power and efficiency. This offers a deep comprehension of the energy harvesting system, evaluating different possibilities related to complex behaviors such as dynamical jumps, bifurcations, and chaos.},

The possibility of stabilizing these periodic patterns with a small amount of energy makes this kind of response interesting to various dynamical systems. Energy harvesting has as a goal the use of available mechanical energy by promoting a conversion into electrical energy. The combination of these two approaches may establish autonomous systems where available environmental mechanical energy can be employed for control purposes. Two different goals can be defined as priority, allowing a change between them: vibration reduction and energy harvesting enhancement. This work deals with the use of harvested energy to perform chaos control. Both control actuation and energy harvesting are induced employing piezoelectric materials, in a simultaneous way. A bistable piezomagnetoelastic structure subjected to harmonic excitations is investigated as a case study. Numerical simulations show situations where it is possible to perform chaos control using only the energy generated by the harvesting system.},

One of the main challenges is to develop devices capable of adapting to diverse sources of environmental excitation, being able to efficiently operate over a broadband frequency spectrum. This work proposes a novel multimodal design of a piezoelectric energy harvesting system to harness energy from a wideband ambient vibration source. Circular-shaped and pizza-shaped designs are employed as candidates for the device, comparing their performance with classical beam-shaped devices. Finite element analysis is employed to model system dynamics using ANSYS Workbench. An optimization procedure is applied to the system aiming to seek a configuration that can extract energy from a broader frequency spectrum and maximize its output power. A comparative analysis with conventional energy harvesting systems is performed. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the harvester performances under harmonic and random excitations. Results show that the proposed multimodal harvester has potential to harness energy from broadband ambient vibration sources presenting performance advantages in comparison to conventional single-mode energy harvesters.},

Due to their inherent characteristics and electromechanical interaction, the system damping for piezoelectric energy harvesting can be adequately characterized by fractional calculus. This paper introduces the fractional model for magnetically coupling broadband energy harvesters under low-frequency excitation and investigates their nonlinear dynamic characteristics. The effects of fractional-order damping, excitation amplitude, and frequency on dynamic behaviors are proposed using the phase trajectory, power spectrum, Poincare map, and bifurcation diagram. The numerical analysis shows that the fractionally damped energy harvesting system exhibits chaos, periodic motion, chaos and periodic motion in turn when the fractional order changes from 0.2 to 1.5. The period doubling route to chaos and the inverse period doubling route from chaos to periodic motion can be clearly observed. It is also demonstrated numerically and experimentally that the magnetically coupling piezoelectric energy harvester possesses the usable frequency bandwidth over a wide range of low-frequency excitation. Both high-energy chaotic attractors and large-amplitude periodic response with inter-well oscillators dominate these broadband energy harvesting.},

	abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed several advances in microfabrication technologies and electronics, leading to the development of small, low-power devices for wireless sensing, data transmission, actuation, and medical implants. Unfortunately, the actual implementation of such devices in their respective environment has been hindered by the lack of scalable energy sources that are necessary to power and maintain them. Batteries, which remain the most commonly used power sources, have not kept pace with the demands of these devices, especially in terms of energy density. In light of this challenge, the concept of vibratory energy harvesting has flourished in recent years as a possible alternative to provide a continuous power supply. While linear vibratory energy harvesters have received the majority of the literature's attention, a significant body of the current research activity is focused on the concept of purposeful inclusion of nonlinearities for broadband transduction. When compared to their linear resonant counterparts, nonlinear energy harvesters have a wider steady-state frequency bandwidth, leading to a common belief that they can be utilized to improve performance in ambient environments. Through a review of the open literature, this paper highlights the role of nonlinearities in the transduction of energy harvesters under different types of excitations and investigates the conditions, in terms of excitation nature and potential shape, under which such nonlinearities can be beneficial for energy harvesting.},

This article experimentally analyzes the influence of capacitive electrical loads and extends the excitation type to tip impulse. For resistive-capacitive electrical loads, the maximum energy conversion efficiency achieved under impulsive excitation is 5.93\%, while the maximum output power and output power density observed for a 139.5 Hz, 3 [Formula: see text] amplitude sinusoidal base excitation is 0.45 W and 6.88 [Formula: see text], respectively, which are 8\% higher than those measured under purely resistive loads.

A frequently used modeling approach is the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modeling of the harvester beam as it allows simple expressions for the electrical outputs. In the literature, since the base excitation on the harvester beam is assumed to be harmonic, the well known SDOF relation is employed for mathematical modeling. In this study, it is shown that the commonly accepted SDOF harmonic base excitation relation may yield highly inaccurate results for predicting the motion of cantilevered beams and bars. First, the response of a cantilevered Euler—Bernoulli beam to general base excitation given in terms of translation and small rotation is reviewed where more sophisticated damping models are considered. Then, the error in the SDOF model is shown and correction factors are derived for improving the SDOF harmonic base excitation model both for transverse and longitudinal vibrations. The formal way of treating the components of mechanical damping is also discussed. After deriving simple expressions for the electrical outputs of the PZT in open-circuit conditions, relevance of the electrical outputs to vibration mode shapes and the electrode locations is investigated and the issue of strain nodes is addressed.},

In this paper, we present the exact analytical solution of a cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvester with Euler–Bernoulli beam assumptions. The excitation of the harvester is assumed to be due to its base motion in the form of translation in the transverse direction with small rotation, and it is not restricted to be harmonic in time. The resulting expressions for the coupled mechanical response and the electrical outputs are then reduced for the particular case of harmonic behavior in time and closed-form exact expressions are obtained. Simple expressions for the coupled mechanical response, voltage, current, and power outputs are also presented for excitations around the modal frequencies. Finally, the model proposed is used in a parametric case study for a unimorph harvester, and important characteristics of the coupled distributed parameter system, such as short circuit and open circuit behaviors, are investigated in detail. Modal electromechanical coupling and dependence of the electrical outputs on the locations of the electrodes are also discussed with examples.},

	abstract = {Cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters have been extensively investigated in the literature of energy harvesting. As an alternative to conventional cantilevered beams, this article presents the L-shaped beam-mass structure as a new piezoelectric energy harvester configuration. This structure can be tuned to have the first two natural frequencies relatively close to each other, resulting in the possibility of a broader band energy harvesting system. This article describes the important features of the L-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester configuration and develops a linear distributed parameter model for predicting the electromechanically coupled voltage response and displacement response of the harvester structure. After deriving the coupled distributed parameter model, a case study is presented to investigate the electrical power generation performance of the L-shaped energy harvester. A direct application of the L-shaped piezoelectric energy harvester configuration is proposed for use as landing gears in unmanned air vehicle applications and a case study is presented where the results of the L-shaped — energy harvester — landing gear are favorably compared against the published experimental results of a curved beam configuration used for the same purpose.},

Firstly, the dynamic equation is derived by the Newtonian method after calculating the acceleration of the fluid element via the dynamics approach. Secondly, the discrete form of the dynamic equation is formulated by the Galerkin method. Thirdly, the numerical analysis of the system is carried out through the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparison with the analytical results obtained by the mode superposition method. In the example analysis, the responses of the lateral deflection and bending moment are investigated for the pinned-pinned, clamped-pinned, and clamped-clamped PCF. The effects of fluid velocity and the moving frequencies of supports are discussed. Especially, the deflection responses are analyzed under extreme condition; i.e., the moving frequency of a support is identical to the natural frequency of PCF.},

	abstract = {Vibration-based energy harvesting is of increasing importance and there is a current challenge to improve energy harvesting capacity exploiting nonlinear and random effects. This article investigates random effects in a nonlinear energy harvesting system. The system is represented by a magnetoelastic structure with two piezoceramic layers attached to the root of a cantilever beam, obtaining a bimorph generator. The energy harvesting system is subjected to three excitation conditions: pure harmonic, pure random and a combination of harmonic and random excitations. Noise-to-Signal Ratio (NSR) is employed to quantify different combinations of the forcing terms, establishing a procedure to evaluate the system performance. This approach is based on Power Spectral Density (PSD) of input and output signals. Numerical simulations are carried out, identifying the better combinations of harmonic and random excitations for energy harvesting purposes. Discussions about the influence of the kind of response are carried out evaluating the differences between periodic and chaotic motions. Conclusions show that both random and nonlinear effects can be tuned in order to enhance energy harvesting capacity.},

	abstract = {Conventional vibration energy harvesters have been usually studied as single-degree-of-freedom models. The fact that such harvesters are only efficient near sole resonance limits their applicability in frequency-variant or random vibration scenarios. In this article, a novel multiple-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric energy harvesting model is presented. First, a two-degree-of-freedom model is analyzed, and its two configurations are characterized. In the first configuration, the piezoelectric element is placed between one mass and the base, and in the second configuration, it is placed between the two masses. It is shown that the former is advantageous over the latter since with a slight increase of overall weight to the single-degree-of-freedom model, we can achieve two close and effective peaks in power response or one effective peak with significantly enhanced magnitude. The first configuration is then generalized to an n-degree-of-freedom model, and its analytical solution is derived. This solution provides a convenient tool for parametric study and design of a multiple-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric energy harvesting model. Finally, the equivalent circuit model of the proposed n-degree-of-freedom piezoelectric energy harvesting model is developed via the analogy between the mechanical and electric domains. With the equivalent circuit model, system-level electric simulation can be performed to evaluate the system performance when sophisticated interface circuits are attached.},

	abstract = {The dramatic reduction in power consumption of current integrated circuits has evoked great research interests in harvesting ambient energy, such as vibrations, as a potential power supply for electronic devices to avoid battery replacement. Currently, most vibration-based energy harvesters are designed as linear resonators to achieve optimal performance by matching their resonance frequencies with the ambient excitation frequencies a priori. However, a slight shift of the excitation frequency will cause a dramatic reduction in performance. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of practical cases, the ambient vibrations are frequency-varying or totally random with energy distributed over a wide frequency spectrum. Hence, developing techniques to increase the bandwidth of vibration-based energy harvesters has become the next important problem in energy harvesting. This article reviews the advances made in the past few years on this issue. The broadband vibration-based energy harvesting solutions, covering resonance tuning, multimodal energy harvesting, frequency up-conversion, and techniques exploiting non-linear oscillations, are summarized in detail with regard to their merits and applicability in different circumstances.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear tri-stable piezoelectric energy harvesters with magnetic field coupling have attracted many researchers’ interest in ambient vibration energy harvesting and conversion. In such a tri-stable piezoelectric energy harvester, the nonlinear magnetic force generated by the external magnetic field is mainly calculated by the equivalent magnetic dipole method. However, this method will give highly erroneous results when the magnetic separation distance is small. This study presents a modified magnetic force model to precisely calculate the nonlinear magnetic force exerted on the tip of the cantilever beam. Unlike the equivalent magnetic dipole method regarding the magnet as a point dipole at its body center, this model only considers the surface magnetization current of the left and right surfaces of the magnets and replaced them by the one of the center point dipoles on these associated surfaces. With this model, the nonlinear magnetic force, the potential energy, and the transition mechanism of the tri-stable piezoelectric energy harvester are numerically investigated. Experimental validations are consequently performed to testify the numerical results. Compared with the equivalent magnetic dipole method, the modified magnetic force model has a much higher accuracy to be more applicable for different magnetic separation distances, especially when the magnetic separation distance is small.},

	abstract = {Energy harvesting from ambient vibrations using piezoelectric effect is a promising alternative solution for powering small electronics such as wireless sensors. A conventional piezoelectric energy harvester usually consists of a cantilevered beam with a proof mass at its free end. For such a device, the second resonance of the piezoelectric energy harvester is usually ignored because of its high frequency as well as low response level compared to the first resonance. Hence, only the first mode has been frequently exploited for energy harvesting in the reported literature. In this article, a novel compact piezoelectric energy harvester using two vibration modes has been developed. The harvester comprises one main cantilever beam and an inner secondary cantilever beam, each of which is bonded with piezoelectric transducers. By varying the proof masses, the first two resonant frequencies of the harvester can be tuned close enough to achieve useful wide bandwidth. Meanwhile, this compact design efficiently utilizes the cantilever beam by generating significant power output from both the main and secondary beams. An experiment and simulation were carried out to validate the design concept. The results show that the proposed novel piezoelectric energy harvester is more adaptive and functional in practical vibrational circumstances.},
